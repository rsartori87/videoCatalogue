videoCatalogue
==============

A simple video player that I made in my spare time while I'm kinda between jobs.
It's simple but uses solr for the full-text search and activemq to deferr the thumbnails generation.
The main page has a very simple infinite scroll (in angular.js but I don't like it probably I will reimplent that in react.js) with all the thumbnails generated generated by node from the media found in the vide_path (that could be set in the parameters.yml).

It's a toy project nothing really solid.
